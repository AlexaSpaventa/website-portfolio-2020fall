For the final version of my website I started out by checking the comments I received
for improvement. One suggestion I received was to reorganize my repository so that it was a bit more organized and things were easier to navigate. I did this by adding an ASSETS folder in my docs folder for all the images I used. I also updated my CREDITS.md file with the needed citations for the images I used on my website. Additionally, I helped make my website more accessible by adding alt tags to all the images I used with descriptive titles. Another suggestion I received was to add some JavaScript elements to my website so I also went ahead and added the suggested scrolling animation. Since my website is a scrolling site this animation shows the scrolling past the other pages rather than just jumping to the selected page and this definitely seems more smooth and makes the website feel more complete. Honestly, I am really happy how this website turned out. It doesn’t scale perfectly to all platforms but for the most part it can still be used on mobile and differently sized browsers. As far as content goes I plan to keep adding to it as I gain more work experience and complete more personal projects. A lot of the internships I’ve been applying for offer the option to include a personal website so this has been a good way for me to build one and get some experience with CSS.
