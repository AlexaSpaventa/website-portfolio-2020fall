This project is a personal website which I designed to showcase the computer science related work I've done since coming to college. With this goal in mind, the site includes my work experiance, the courses I've taken, an education section, projects I've made, and the organizations I am a part of. To design this site I used mostly HTML and CSS with some JavaScript elements such as scrolling included as well. In general the site is themed around a purple and pink pastel color scheme with section headers being a darker pruple and section content being a more pastel shade. I also incorporated GIMP as a tool for image editing when making this webiste. This was done with the headers for each of my pages as well as the pitt logo included in the education section. For credits of all images can be found HERE. All unsourced images were take/created by me.
